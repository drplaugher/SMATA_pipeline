# SMATA_pipeline

Attached in this repository are the code and data used in my doctoral thesis *Assembling an Integrated Pipeline to Construct Patient-Specific Cancer Models*[^1]. Specifically, you will find:

Phenotype control example files:
- ck_example.txt -- text file for Contol Kernel example expressions
- edge_control_example.txt -- text file for edge control, can save as an M2 file
- FVS_example.py -- python file to run Feedback Vertex Set control
- node_control_example.txt -- text file for node control, can save as an M2 file
- SM_example.txt -- text file of Boolean rules for Stable Motif example
- SM_example.py -- python file to run Stable Motifs
- thesis_examples.m -- cumulative MATLAB file of examples
- thesisTC1.txt -- time-course data for EQL example

 *How-To* files that detail how to find controls and simulate:
- Guide for Controls
- How-To Simulate


<br />

Necessary MATLAB functions and files 
- MATLAB Toolbox

For files specific to the pancreatic cancer chapters, see https://github.com/drplaugher/PCC_Mutations. Some code/files have been adapted from previously published versions, and I have tried to make such notes within the relevent files.
